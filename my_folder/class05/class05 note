Choosing the best stump:
The choice of stumps and predictors aim to minimize the misclassified rate-error rate.

Pros and Cons:
Bigger the tree size, bigger the variance and lower the bias. Vice versa.

How to choose parameters:
Cross validation / Iterations and stumps

What if the targer region is blank?
No prediction available

Pruning
Run all possible branches and try everything to get the smallest error. 
Note: There is alpha from 0 to infinity
as alpha increases, the last iterations are gone based on a sequence decided by alpha.
Using this, we are not trying all possible combinations, but delete things from the decision trees in a certain order
