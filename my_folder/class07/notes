ensembles and bagging
n observations /several predictors/ sample n observations with duplicated replacement
1/3 would be out of bag
For binary response variable:
Instead of learning on residuals, a consecutive tree leans on classes re-weighted so that observations that are incorrectly classified get a higher weight.
. means fitting all the predictors
yhat1 <- predict(my_fit) produced oob predictions
